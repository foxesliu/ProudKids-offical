                                    <p>One of the biggest advantages is that teachers have regular students (which you
                                        signed up and made efforts to work with you) and you can monitor their
                                        improvements at all time. In Proud Kids, you are not only teaching a language
                                        but also helping children to cultivate critical thinking ability. And the most
                                        important part is to have FUN for you and the kids together! </p>

                                        it will require reliable and fast internet connection to have that WOW teaching

                        between 5-12 years old in
                        China.</p>
                    <p>We are the first online English education company in China to have combined local English
                        teachers with native English-speaking teachers in English teaching. Our curriculum design aligns
                        with the local English education system. </p>
                    <p class="mb-40">We aim to provide high-quality and equal English learning opportunities to children
                        all over
                        China, empowering more children to speak English with authentic pronunciation. We do it right
                        from the start and never compromise! </p>
                    <p><span class="color-orange">Proud Kids</span> has incorporated an authentic English teaching
                        system based on CLIL (Content and
                        Language Integrated Learning) with China's new national curriculum for English, aiming to help
                        children in China between the ages of 5-12 to learn authentic English more effectively.</p>
                    <p>Unlike other English education providers, we believe that children should not learn English from
                        frequently changing teachers. Having the same teacher teaching for a certain period will result
                        better teacher-student bond, relationship, students' learning experience and performance. </p>
